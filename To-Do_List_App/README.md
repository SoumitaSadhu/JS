# 📝 To-Do List App

A responsive and interactive **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This app allows users to **add, edit, and delete tasks**, while automatically saving data in **Local Storage** — so your tasks remain even after reloading the page.  
It also displays a **completion progress bar** showing what percentage of tasks are done.
